# YouTube Channels Configuration
# 
# List channels to track. Each channel can be specified by:
# - Channel ID (e.g., UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw)
# - Handle (e.g., @GoogleDevelopers)
# - URL (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/@GoogleDevelopers)
#
# Per-channel options:
# - max_videos: Limit videos to fetch (most recent first)
# - max_video_age_days: Only fetch videos within this many days
# - fetch_comments: true/false (default: true)
# - video_discovery_mode: auto/search/playlist (default: auto)
# - comments_update_hours: Hours before re-fetching comments (default: 24)
# - comments_update_hours_new: Hours for videos < 7 days old (default: 6)
# - new_video_days: Videos younger than this are "new" (default: 7)
#
# NOTE: Transcripts are fetched separately using fetch_transcripts.py
# because YouTube blocks transcript requests from cloud/CI environments.
# Run locally: python fetch_transcripts.py --channel @YourChannel

channels:

  # Detailed format with options
  # - identifier: "@mkbhd"
  #   max_videos: 500           # Only most recent 500 videos
  #   max_video_age_days: 365   # Only videos from last year
  #   fetch_comments: true
  #   video_discovery_mode: auto  # auto, search, or playlist
  #   comments_update_hours: 24      # Re-check comments every 24h for older videos
  #   comments_update_hours_new: 4   # Re-check every 4h for new videos
  #   new_video_days: 7              # Videos < 7 days old are "new"
  
  # For very large/prolific channels, force playlist mode to detect deletions:
  # - identifier: "@TheMajorityReport"
  #   max_videos: 1000
  #   max_video_age_days: 90    # Only last 90 days
  #   video_discovery_mode: playlist  # Always use playlist (detects deletions)
  #   fetch_comments: false     # Skip comments to save quota

# Global settings (can be overridden per-channel)
settings:
  # Rate limiting: requests per second to YouTube API
  requests_per_second: 2.0
  
  # Default max comments per video
  max_comments_per_video: 500
  
  # Max videos to fetch comments for per channel per run
  # Prevents extremely long runs on large channels
  max_comment_videos: 200
  
  # Parallel workers for comment fetching (1=sequential, 3-5 recommended)
  comment_workers: 3
  
  # Video discovery mode:
  # - auto: Use search API for incremental updates, playlist for backfill (default)
  # - search: Always use search API (100 units/call, stops at known videos)
  # - playlist: Always use playlist API (1 unit/50 videos, fetches all, detects deletions)
  video_discovery_mode: auto
  
  # Comment update frequency
  comments_update_hours: 24        # Default for older videos
  comments_update_hours_new: 6     # Default for new videos (< new_video_days old)
  new_video_days: 7                # Videos younger than this get more frequent updates
  
  # Recommended constraints for large-scale tracking:
  # - Set max_video_age_days: 90-365 for ongoing analysis
  # - Set max_videos: 500-2000 for initial backfill
  # - Use fetch_comments: false for channels with high volume
