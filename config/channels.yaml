# YouTube Channels Configuration
# 
# List channels to track. Each channel can be specified by:
# - Channel ID (e.g., UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw)
# - Handle (e.g., @GoogleDevelopers)
# - URL (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/@GoogleDevelopers)
#
# Per-channel options:
# - max_videos: Limit videos to fetch (most recent first)
# - max_video_age_days: Only fetch videos within this many days
# - fetch_comments: true/false (default: true)
# - max_comment_videos: Max videos to fetch comments for per run (default: 200)
# - max_comments_per_video: Max comments per video (default: 100)
# - min_new_comments: Skip videos with < N new comments (default: 10, set 0 to disable)
# - comment_workers: Parallel workers for comment fetching (default: 5)
# - video_discovery_mode: auto/search/playlist (default: auto)
# - comments_update_hours: Hours before re-fetching comments (default: 24)
# - comments_update_hours_new: Hours for videos < 7 days old (default: 6)
# - new_video_days: Videos younger than this are "new" (default: 7)
#
# NOTE: Transcripts are fetched separately using fetch_transcripts.py
# because YouTube blocks transcript requests from cloud/CI environments.
# Run locally: python fetch_transcripts.py --channel @YourChannel

  # Detailed format with options
  # - identifier: "@mkbhd"
  #   max_videos: 500                # Only most recent 500 videos
  #   max_video_age_days: 365        # Only videos from last year
  #   fetch_comments: true
  #   max_comment_videos: 200        # Max videos to fetch comments for per run
  #   max_comments_per_video: 100    # Max comments per video
  #   min_new_comments: 10           # Skip videos with < 10 new comments
  #   comment_workers: 5             # Parallel workers for comments
  #   video_discovery_mode: auto     # auto, search, or playlist
  #   comments_update_hours: 24      # Re-check comments every 24h for older videos
  #   comments_update_hours_new: 4   # Re-check every 4h for new videos
  #   new_video_days: 7              # Videos < 7 days old are "new"
  
  # For high-engagement channels, limit comment scope to reduce runtime:
  # - identifier: "@podsaveamerica"
  #   max_comment_videos: 50         # Only fetch comments for 50 most recent videos
  #   max_comments_per_video: 50     # Cap at 50 comments per video
  #   min_new_comments: 20           # Skip videos with < 20 new comments
  #   comment_workers: 8             # Use more workers for faster processing

  # For very large/prolific channels, force playlist mode to detect deletions:
  # - identifier: "@TheMajorityReport"
  #   max_videos: 1000
  #   max_video_age_days: 90         # Only last 90 days
  #   video_discovery_mode: playlist # Always use playlist (detects deletions)
  #   fetch_comments: false          # Skip comments to save quota

# Global settings (can be overridden per-channel)
settings:
  # Rate limiting: requests per second to YouTube API
  requests_per_second: 2.0

  # Comment fetching settings
  max_comments_per_video: 100        # Max comments per video (matches 1 API call)
  max_comment_videos: 200            # Max videos to fetch comments for per run
  min_new_comments: 10               # Skip videos with < N new comments (0 = disabled)
  comment_workers: 5                 # Parallel workers for comment fetching

  # Parallel workers for channel processing (1=sequential, 2-3 for faster runs)
  # Each worker creates its own DB connection and API client
  # Quota tracking uses a dedicated connection with auto-checkpointing
  # NOTE: Turso/libsql backend auto-disables parallel workers due to thread-safety issues
  #       Use PostgreSQL backend (DATABASE_BACKEND=postgres) for parallel processing
  channel_workers: 1

  # Video discovery mode:
  # - auto: Use search API for incremental updates, playlist for backfill (default)
  # - search: Always use search API (100 units/call, stops at known videos)
  # - playlist: Always use playlist API (1 unit/50 videos, fetches all, detects deletions)
  video_discovery_mode: auto
  
  # Comment update frequency
  comments_update_hours: 24        # Default for older videos
  comments_update_hours_new: 6     # Default for new videos (< new_video_days old)
  new_video_days: 7                # Videos younger than this get more frequent updates
  
  # Recommended constraints for large-scale tracking:
  # - Set max_video_age_days: 90-365 for ongoing analysis
  # - Set max_videos: 500-2000 for initial backfill
  # - For high-engagement channels: lower max_comment_videos and increase min_new_comments
  # - Use fetch_comments: false for channels with very high comment volume
